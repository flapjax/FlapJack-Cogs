A collection of cogs I have developed for Red Bot.  
View them on the [Red Cogs Portal](https://cogs.red/cogs/flapjax/FlapJack-Cogs/), where you will also find installation instructions.

- **Blizzard** - Fetches and prints latest patch notes and some (limited) user data from current Blizzard games.
- **ColorMe** - Allows users to manage the color of their own name through custom roles with default permissions.
- **Defcon** - A nod to the 1983 film War Games. Maintain a DEFCON system on your server, displayed through creative use of embeds.
- **Dongers** - Fetches and prints a random Donger from www.dongerlist.com.
- **gtts** - Experimental cog using the Google TTS service and tmerc's playsound code to play TTS in a voice channel.
- **Msgvote** - Turn a Discord channel into a Reddit thread... if that's something you're into...
- **ReactPoll** - Functions exactly like Red's built-in polls, but uses numeric reactions instead of typed responses.
- **SFX** - Inject sound effects into voice channels. Compatible with other audio, and backwards compatible with tmerc's playsound!
- **SmartReact** - Set up automatic emoji reactions to specific words in chat. Like trigger, but with emojis.
- **Smite** - Smite statistics using the official Smite API.
- **Spoiler** - Hide spoilers in chat using animated GIFs that require a mouseover.
- **Wat** - Assist users who have trouble 'hearing' what people type! :)
